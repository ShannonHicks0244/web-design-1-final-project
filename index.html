            <h2>About Me.</h2>

            <p>My name is Shannon and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.</p>

            <p>Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience
                with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign),
                Figma, and Sketch. </p>

            <p>I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to
                experiment with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.</p>

            <h2>Full Branding</h2>
            <p>Your brand is much more than just a logo or a website. It's the overall image that your business presents
                to the world, including the look, feel, and voice of your brand. I can help you create a cohesive and
                impactful brand that resonates with your target audience and sets you apart from your competitors.</p>
